Hi, I’m @DreamyPelican a yet another beginner in development!

I still searching my path, but my heart swings between front-end, mobile and game development.

I'm currently learning OOP paradigm with Python and how to apply it. Despite I have so much
to learn, it's really satisfying to create and find out how things works.
And I'm also learning JavaScript by a professional training.

If you want to reach me, here's my Discord : <br>
